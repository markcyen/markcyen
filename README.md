### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my humble Github abode.

Grateful for you taking the time to visit my profile and projects. I am a software developer seeking to create applications that could help others and myself as well. In early 2021, I started to pick up Ruby on Rails. My hope is to hone these skills and utilize what I have learn in software development, coupled with prior experiences in finance and goverment, to make apps that improves the world in some way. I enjoy learning to code and teaching what I have learned to others, as well as grow and encourage others to be challenged as a team and community.
